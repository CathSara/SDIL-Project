# SDIL-Project


in the server folder i used the command to install packages we can use in the backend: 
- npm install express cors 
- installed npm nodemon (this ensures, that if you change index.js file and save it, the server will run automatically)

have to decide which database we want to use -  MySQL? or do we need a non relational database like MongoDB
